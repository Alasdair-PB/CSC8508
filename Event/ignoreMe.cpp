/**
 * It seems you've found the all important ignoreMe.cpp file!
 *
 * Basically, CMake libraries NEED a .cpp file to determine the linker language, even if said file is empty.
 * So that's why this file exists. If we later add a normal .cpp file, we can delete this one. Until then,
 * this file will continue to exist
